In addition to enabling notifications for out-of-app channels like email, push, SMS, and chat platforms such as Slack, Novu makes it seamless to create powerful **in-app notification experiences** that users love.

With Novu’s **Inbox** component and **SDKs**, you can quickly build **stateful, in-app notification systems** including inboxes, floating feeds, toasts, banners, and more—all fully customizable to fit your app's design and behavior. 

Novu also supports **granular user preferences**, allowing you to easily integrate **user-facing preference management** using our Preferences component.
