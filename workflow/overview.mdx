Our browser-based **Workflow Builder (Editor)** makes it simple to create personalized, automated messaging workflowsâ€”no coding required.

## Workflow Elements / Building Blocks

All Novu workflows consist of four basic elements:

- **Workflow Identifier** which is used as the trigger id 
- A **trigger** that starts the workflow
- **Channel Step** that send notifications to your configured channels
- **Action Steps** that control the flow of the workflow and produce state for use in templates 

### Workflow Identifier (Settings)

Give your Workflow a clear, descriptive name that your team can easily identify. The workflow identifier "new-signup" is used as the trigger id. Workflow identifiers should be unique to your application and descriptive of the workflow's purpose.

For example:

- Abandoned Cart Recovery
- Password Reset Flow
- New User Welcome Series
- Re-engagement Campaign

### Trigger

Every workflow starts with a **trigger**. This is the event that starts a workflow. It represents an action or event that initiates the workflow by making a call to the Novu API, along with a specified workflow trigger identifier (`workflow_id`). The identifier helps match the trigger to the corresponding workflow. 

When a trigger occurs, it sends the necessary payload data that the workflow will use to deliver notifications to subscribers. **Learn more about subscribers**.

Triggers are the primary and only method for sending notifications. The trigger identifier ensures that the correct workflow is executed.

**Example of a Trigger**
Here's an example of an API call to trigger an event:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.novu.co/v2/events/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey <NOVU_SECRET_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>",
    "to": {
      "subscriberId": "<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>",
    },
    "payload": {}
    }
  }'
```

### Channel Step

A **Channel Step** in Novu represents a configured provider to send notifications to your recipients.

The Workflow Editor is designed for **Omni-Channel Communication**, delivering a unified experience across diverse messaging channels:

- **In-App Notifications**
- **Email**
- **SMS**
- **Push**
  - **Mobile Push**
  - **Web Push**
- **Chat**
  - **Enterprise Messaging Platforms** (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams)
  - **Consumer Messaging Apps** (e.g., WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord)

Most providers within Novu use credentials that you supply to deliver notifications on your behalf. These credentials and other settings are what make a configured channel. 

### Action Step

**Action Steps** are purpose built functions that help manage the workflow flow. **Action Steps** can be executed before and after **Channel Steps**. 
For example, you can use a **Delay** to pause a workflow for a certain duration before sending a notification.

There are three types of Action Steps supported by Novu:

- Delay
- Digest
- Custom

## Key Features

- **Failure Resilience**
  - Ensures workflows resume from point of failure during platform outages
  - Guarantees processing of critical notifications in unstable environments

  - Manages time-sensitive processes like batched notifications and digest emails
  - Optimized for platforms with strict execution time limits
  - Ideal for serverless environments

- **Event-Driven Workflow Management**
  - Supports workflow pausing until external events occur
  - Perfect for scenarios like:
    - Waiting for user actions (e.g., confirmation link clicks)
    - Responding to asynchronous notifications from integrated services

- **Scheduled Notifications**
  - Automates recurring communication
  - Supports cron-based scheduling
  - Easily manage reminders, routine updates

- **Parallel Notification Delivery**
  - Sends multiple notifications simultaneously
  - Ensures successful completion of all notifications
  - Minimizes delays in multi-channel communication

- **Delays and Throttling**
  - Schedules notifications or retries with flexible timing
  - Supports delays ranging from minutes to months
  - No platform-imposed timing limitations

- **Reliable Delivery**
  - Guarantees at-least-once delivery for every notification
  - Ensures no important events are lost

- **Cost-Efficient Processing**
  - Offloads heavy notification-related tasks to Novu
  - Handles template rendering and retries
  - Optimizes resource usage in serverless/time-billed environments

- **Rate Limiting**
  - Protects integrated services from overwhelming traffic
  - Sets maximum delivery rates
  - Handles burst traffic seamlessly

- **Observability & Insights**
  - Monitors every workflow lifecycle stage
  - Provides robust tracking
  - Offers insights into:
    - Successful deliveries
    - Retries
    - Delays
    - Failures

## How it work

Workflow Builder builds on the principle of steps. Instead of defining a single, complex piece of business logic, workflows contain multiple individual steps.

In case of an error, a failed step is retried individually without needing to re-run any previous steps. Instead of the entire business logic, each step can take up your serverless function execution duration, and many more benefits.
