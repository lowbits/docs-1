Each channel step in a Novu workflow comes with its own notification template. This template defines how notifications appear for a specific channel.

In this page, we’ll explore the features of the Novu template editor and how you can leverage them to create personalized, visually appealing, and effective notifications.

We'll cover:

- **Injecting variables from your trigger data into your notification template.**
- **Using Liquid syntax for logic and control flow within templates.**
- **Previewing and testing your notification templates.**

## Personalizing Notifications with Template Variables

To insert a variable into your Novu notification template, use double curly braces: `{{ variable_name }}`.

Novu templates allow you to reference several types of variables:

### Data Payload Variables
These variables originate from the data payload in your workflow trigger. 
For example, if you include `{ "order_id": "12345" }` in your payload, you can reference it in your template as `{{ payload.data.order_id }}`.

### User Properties
You can access user properties (like `firstName` or `data.plan`) using `{{ subscriber.property }}`. For instance:

```liquid
Hi {{ subscriber.firstName }},

You’ve been upgraded to the {{ subscriber.data.plan }} plan.

Thanks,  
The Novu Team
```

## Adding Logic with Liquid filters

Novu supports Liquid syntax for dynamic and conditional content in templates. Commonly used filters include:

### Conditional Statements
Display different content based on trigger data or user properties. 

For example:

```liquid
{% if total_items > 1 %}
  {{ actor.name }} added {{ total_items }} items to your list.
{% else %}
  {{ actor.name }} added an item to your list.
{% endif %}
```

You can also use filters like `split` and `first` for advanced variable manipulation. For example:

```liquid
You've been invited by {{ actor.name | split: " " | first }} to join {{ data.workspace_name }} on Novu.
```

Learn more about Liquid syntax in the [Liquid documentation](https://liquidjs.com/index.html).

## Previewing and Testing Notification Templates

When your notification template is ready, use the **Preview** mode to visualize how your notification will look. You can:

- **Test dynamic payload data:**.
- **Send test notifications:** Save your template, return to the workflow canvas, and run a test with real trigger data.
