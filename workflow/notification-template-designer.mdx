Each channel step in a Novu workflow comes with its own notification template. This template defines how notifications appear for a specific channel.

In this page, we’ll explore the features of the Novu template editor and how you can leverage them to create personalized, visually appealing, and effective notifications.

- **Injecting variables from your trigger data into your notification template.**
- **Using Liquid syntax for logic and control flow within templates.**
- **Previewing and testing your notification templates.**

## Personalizing Notifications with Template Variables

To insert a variable into your Novu notification template, use double curly braces: `{{ variable_name }}`.

Novu templates allow you to reference several types of variables:

### Data Payload Variables
These variables originate from the data payload in your workflow trigger. 
For example, if you include `{ "order_id": "12345" }` in your payload, you can reference it in your template as `{{ payload.order_id }}`.

### User Properties
You can access user properties (like `firstName` or custom subscriber properties) using `{{ subscriber.* }}`. For instance:

```liquid
Hi {{ subscriber.firstName }},

You’ve been upgraded to the {{ subscriber.data.plan }} plan.

Thanks,  
The Novu Team
```

## Adding Logic with Liquid filters

Novu supports Liquid syntax for dynamic and conditional content in templates.

You can use filters like `capitalize` and `first` for advanced variable manipulation. For example:

```liquid
You've been invited by {{ subscriber.firstName | capitalize }} to join {{ payload.workspace_name }} on Novu.
```

Learn more about all Liquid syntax in the [Liquid documentation](https://liquidjs.com/index.html).

## Previewing and Testing Notification Templates

When your notification template is ready, use the **Preview** mode to visualize how your notification will look. You can:

- **Test dynamic payload data:** Provide sample data to see how your template renders with different values.
- **Send test notifications:** Save your template, return to the workflow canvas, and run a test with real trigger data.
