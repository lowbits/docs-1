The **Workflow Editor** simplifies building automated, personalized workflows without coding while also allowing developers to refine code-based workflows. 

## Workflow Building Blocks

Every Novu workflow is built using these four key elements:

- **Workflow Identifier**: A unique ID used to link triggers to the correct workflow
- **Trigger**: The event or action that starts the workflow
- **Channel Steps**: These send notifications through your configured channels
- **Action Steps**: Functions that manage the workflow’s logic and control its flow

### Workflow Identifier

Give your Workflow a clear, descriptive name that your team can easily identify. 
Workflow identifiers should be unique to your application and descriptive of the workflow's purpose.

For example:

- Abandoned Cart Recovery
- Password Reset Flow
- New User Welcome Series
- Re-engagement Campaign

### Trigger

A trigger starts every workflow. It’s an action or event that tells the workflow to begin. To do this, you call the Novu API with a unique workflow trigger identifier (`workflow_id`), which links the trigger to the correct workflow.

When the trigger happens, it sends the data the workflow needs to notify subscribers. [Learn more about subscribers](/concepts/subscribers).

Triggers are the only way to start workflows and send notifications, making sure everything runs as expected.

**Example of a Trigger**
Here's an example of an API call to trigger an event:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.novu.co/v1/events/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey <NOVU_SECRET_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>",
    "to": {
      "subscriberId": "<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>",
    },
    "payload": {}
  }'
```

### Channel Step

A **Channel Step** in Novu represents a configured provider to send notifications to your recipients.

The Workflow Editor is designed for **Omni-Channel Communication**, delivering a unified experience across diverse messaging channels:

- **In-App Notifications**
- **Email**
- **SMS**
- **Push**
  - **Mobile Push**
  - **Web Push**
- **Chat**
  - **Enterprise Messaging Platforms** (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams)
  - **Consumer Messaging Apps** (e.g., WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord)

Most providers within Novu use credentials that you supply to deliver notifications on your behalf. These credentials and other settings are what make a configured channel. 

### Action Step

**Action Steps** are purpose built functions that help manage the workflow flow. **Action Steps** can be executed before and after **Channel Steps**. 
For example, you can use a **Delay** to pause a workflow for a certain duration before sending a notification.

There are three types of Action Steps supported by Novu:

- **[Delay](/workflow/delay)**
- **[Digest](/workflow/digest)**
- **[Custom](/workflow/custom)**

## How it work

Workflow Builder builds on the principle of steps. Instead of defining a single, complex piece of business logic, workflows contain multiple individual steps.

In case of an error, a failed step is retried individually without needing to re-run any previous steps. Instead of the entire business logic, each step can take up your serverless function execution duration, and many more benefits.
