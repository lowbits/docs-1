Novu was built for endless extensibility. Although not required for majority of your notification usecases, you can customize and extend any aspect of the Novu platform using the Framework SDK powered bridge endpoint.

## Overview

The framework endpoint is a Restful API path that runs on your server and environment and can be used for multiple usecases including:

- Automating workflow creation using GitOps
- Adding custom components to your emails and other channels
- Hydrating resources including subscribers, topics and tenants directly from your database
- Executing custom logic before, during and after a workflow is executed
- Connect to 3rd-party services such as OpenAI, Stripe, Salesforce and more.
- Implement custom delivery providers with internal systems
