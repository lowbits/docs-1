Novu simplifies the complexities of notification management for developers who can then empower the product and marketing teams that need to edit and maintain notification content and copy. 
Novu supports a variety of common notification channels out-of-the-box, including **Email**, **SMS**, **Push**, **Inbox**, and **Chat**.

The [Novu Cloud Platform](https://dashboard.novu.co) provides a UI Dashboard interface, embeddable UI components, monitoring tools, and an optional Framework SDK for extending the platform capabilities.

## Notification types

Novu supports different notification types, including user-generated and machine-generated notifications.

### Machine generated

- Triggered by some automated action—think a container pod scaling event.
- Notify one or more end users (which can be internal users, of course!).
- Often can be voluminous, so digests are helpful.

### Product notifications

- Triggered by end-user interactions and events within your product.
- Notify one or more subscribers.
- Typically transactional, such as order updates, password resets, account verifications, or login/OTP codes.
- Can also be used to provide product updates, such as new features or bug fixes.

### Key differences

- Product notifications are triggered by user activity, while promotional notifications are sent at the discretion of the marketer.
- Product notifications are typically more transactional in nature, while promotional notifications are more marketing-oriented.
- Product notifications are often sent to all subscribers, while promotional notifications can be targeted to specific audiences.

## Who is Novu for?

How you use and get started with Novu depends on your role. While it’s initially implemented by engineering and development teams, Novu unifies everyone in an organization that authors, creates, sends, manages, and measures results from notifications being sent to end users.
Novu empowers engineers to deliver notification platforms for their product teams.

### Novu for product teams

We are well aware of the friction that often exists between engineering and product teams, and have built features that allow product teams to customize notification experiences easily and safely—without the risk of breaking important integrations and logic.

Product teams can craft beautiful notification content and campaigns in any content framework of their choice.

- Modify and manage notification via the Novu UI Dashboard.
- Gain valuable insights into user engagement with notifications via logs and analytics.

By default, Novu provides a rich No-Code editing experience for product teams to manage notification content and behaviour, which can be extended and customized fully using the [Framework SDK](/sdks/framework/typescript/overview). 
And integrated with a variety of common content frameworks, including [React](/integrations/react-email), [Vue-email](/integrations/vue-email), MJML, and more.

### Novu for end users

Once implemented, most end users will not be aware that it’s Novu behind the scenes, other than that they now receive notifications where and when they expect them.

The [Inbox Component](/inbox/introduction) is an embeddable component that, when included in your app, enables users to view and set their own notification preferences--such as channel, language, timezone, and more.
Novu ensures fast delivery and beautiful notification experiences for end users regardless of the channels involved.

With Novu, your app users receive instant notifications via **email**, **Inbox alerts**, **SMS**, **push notifications**, and **chat**.
